# Surface_Integral

This repository provides a Python implementation for numerically computing the flux of a vector field through a parametric surface using double integrals. The implementation is based on symbolic computation with `sympy` and numerical integration with `numpy`.

## Features

- Compute the flux of a vector field through a parametric surface.
- Symbolic differentiation for partial derivatives of parametric surfaces.
- Numerical integration using a grid-based approach.
- Unit tests to validate the implementation against known results.
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive exploration and visualization.

## Usage

### Running the Flux Computation

You can use the `flux` function from the `src/flux.py` file to compute the flux of a vector field through a parametric surface. Example usage:
```python
from src.flux import flux
from sympy.abc import x, y, z
import sympy as sp

u, v = sp.symbols("u v")
result = flux(
    F=[2 * x, 5 * y, 0],
    r=[u, v, 4 * u + 3 * v],
    u_lim=[0, 1],
    v_lim=[-8, 8],
    dx=0.005
)
print("Computed Flux:", result)
```

### Running Tests

To run the unit tests, execute the following command:

python -m unittest discover tests

### Exploring the Notebook

Open the Jupyter Notebook for an interactive exploration:

jupyter notebook Flux_notebook.ipynb

## Examples

The repository includes several test cases and examples, such as:

1. Computing flux through a plane, sphere, or paraboloid.
2. Validating results against known analytical solutions.
3. Analyzing numerical errors based on grid resolution.
